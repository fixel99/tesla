# Tesla

A simple tesla website for school


ToDo:

1) Embed Google Map and allow for responsive viewing

2) Code to allow Contact Form utilisation

3) Modify Sidebar to allow for mobile/tablet viewing (1/2 done)

4) Add Model Hub Panel before/above particular models and link sidebar to this panel instead. The model hub panel will link to the panels for particular models (1/2 done)

5) Add flagging the current nav as users scroll

6) Add animation/scrolling magic to webpage


After:

Fix fade on pages - 
- Check which element is more onscreen
- Should be unfaded on relevant sidebar hover
- onhover, sidebar should maybe go straight to div
