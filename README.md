# Tesla

A simple tesla website for school


ToDo:

1) Fix updated Favicon not appearing on chrome when using cloud9 (Potential caching issue)

2) Embed Google Map and allow for responsive viewing

3) Code to allow Contact Form utilisation

4) Modify Sidebar to allow for mobile/tablet viewing

5) Add Model Hub Panel before/above particular models and link sidebar to this panel instead. The model hub panel will link to the panels for particular models

6) Add flagging the current nav as users scroll

7) Add animation/scrolling magic to webpage


After:

Fix fade on pages - 
- Check which element is more onscreen
- Should be unfaded on relevant sidebar hover
- onhover, sidebar should maybe go straight to div
